    <ul>
      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>1 medium green pepper, diced</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li> </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.</li>
      <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain.</li>
      <li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
